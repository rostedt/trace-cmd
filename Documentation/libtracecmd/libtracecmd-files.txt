DESCRIPTION
-----------
This set of APIs can be used to open and close a trace file recorded by
*trace-cmd(1)* and containing tracing information from ftrace, the official
Linux kernel tracer. The opened file is represented by a _tracecmd_input_
structure, all other library APIs that work with the file require a pointer
to the structure. The APIs for opening a trace file have a _flag_ input
parameter, which controls how the file will be opened and parsed. The _flag_
is a combination of these options:

 TRACECMD_FL_LOAD_NO_PLUGINS - Do not load any plugins
 TRACECMD_FL_LOAD_NO_SYSTEM_PLUGINS - Do not load system wide plugins, load only "local only"
					plugins from user's home directory.

The *tracecmd_open()* function opens a given trace _file_, parses the
metadata headers from the file, allocates and initializes а _tracecmd_input_
handler structure representing the file. It also initializes the handler
for reading trace data from the file. The returned handler is ready to be
used with _tracecmd_read__ APIs.

The *tracecmd_open_fd()* function does the same as *tracecmd_open()*, but
works with a file descriptor to a trace file, opened for reading.

The *tracecmd_open_head()* function is the same as *tracecmd_open()*, but
does not initialize the handler for reading trace data. It reads and parses
the metadata headers only. The *tracecmd_init_data()* should be used before
using the _tracecmd_read__ APIs.

The *tracecmd_init_data()* function initializes a _handle_, allocated with
*tracecmd_open_head()*, for reading trace data from the file associated with
it. This API must be called before any of the _tracecmd_read__ APIs.

The *tracecmd_close()* function frees a _handle_, pointer to tracecmd_input
structure, previously allocated with *tracecmd_open()*, *tracecmd_open_fd()*
or *tracecmd_open_head()* APIs.

The *tracecmd_set_private()* function allows to add specific _data_ to the
_handle_ that can be retrieved later.

The *tracecmd_get_private()* function will retrieve the _data_ set by
*tracecmd_set_private()* for the given _handle_.

RETURN VALUE
------------
The *tracecmd_open()*, *tracecmd_open_fd()* and *tracecmd_open_head()*
functions return a pointer to tracecmd_input structure or NULL in case of
an error. The returned structure must be free with *tracecmd_close()*.
Note that if *tracecmd_open_fd()* is used to allocate a tracecmd_input handler,
when *tracecmd_close()* is called to close it, that fd will be closed also.

The *tracecmd_init_data()* function returns -1 in case of an error or
0 otherwise.

The *tracecmd_get_private()* returns the _data_ set by *tracecmd_set_private()*.

EXAMPLE
-------
[source,c]
--
The are two different use patterns for opening and reading trace data from
a trace file, which can be used depending on the use case.

1. Open and initialise the trace file in а single step:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <trace-cmd.h>

static int print_events(struct tracecmd_input *handle, struct tep_record *record, int cpu, void *data)
{
	static struct trace_seq seq;
	struct tep_handle *tep = tracecmd_get_tep(handle);
	const char *file = tracecmd_get_private(handle);

	if (!seq.buffer)
		trace_seq_init(&seq);

	trace_seq_reset(&seq);
	trace_seq_printf(&seq, "%s: ", file);
	tep_print_event(tep, &seq, record, "%6.1000d [%03d] %s-%d %s: %s\n",
			TEP_PRINT_TIME, TEP_PRINT_CPU, TEP_PRINT_COMM, TEP_PRINT_PID,
			TEP_PRINT_NAME, TEP_PRINT_INFO);
	trace_seq_terminate(&seq);
	trace_seq_do_printf(&seq);
	return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	struct tracecmd_input *handle;

	if (argc < 2) {
		printf("usage: %s trace.dat\n", argv[0]);
		exit(-1);
	}

	handle = tracecmd_open(argv[i], 0);
	if (!handle)
		exit(-1);

	tracecmd_set_private(handles[nr_handles], argv[i]);
	tracecmd_iterate_events(handles, NULL, 0, print_events, NULL);

	tracecmd_close(handle);
}

2. Open and initialise the trace file in two steps. This allows to perform
some processing based on metadata, read from the file, before initialising
the trace data for reading. Example for such use case is when opening multiple
trace files recorded in a same trace session. In that case timestamps of all
trace events must be adjusted based on the information from  the file's metadata
and before reading the trace data.

#include <trace-cmd.h>
...
struct tracecmd_input *handle = tracecmd_open_head("trace.dat");
	if (!handle) {
		/* Failed to open trace.dat file */
	}
...
	/* do some processing, before initialising the trace data for reading */
...
	if (tracecmd_init_data(handle) < 0) {
		/* Failed to initialize hadle for reading the trace data */
	}
...
	/* Read tracing data from the file, using the handle */
...
	tracecmd_close(handle);
...
