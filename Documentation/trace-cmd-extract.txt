TRACE-CMD-EXTRACT(1)
===================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-extract - extract out the data from the Ftrace Linux tracer.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd extract ['OPTIONS']*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used after 'trace-cmd-start(1)' and
'trace-cmd-stop(1)'. It can be used after the Ftrace tracer has been started
manually through the Ftrace pseudo file system.

The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by
'trace-cmd-report(1)' to read from. It reads the kernel internal ring buffer
to produce the trace.dat file.

OPTIONS
-------
*-p* 'plugin'::
    Although *extract* does not start any traces, some of the plugins require
    just reading the output in ASCII format. These are the latency tracers,
    since the latency tracers have a separate internal buffer. The plugin
    option is therefore only necessary for the 'wakeup', 'wakeup-rt',
    'irqsoff', 'preemptoff' and 'preemptirqsoff' plugins.

    With out this option, the extract command will extract from the internal
    Ftrace buffers.

*-O* 'option'::
    If a latency tracer is being extracted, and the *-p* option is used, then
    there are some Ftrace options that can change the format. This will update
    those options before extracting.  To see the list of options see
    'trace-cmd-list'. To enable an option, write its name, to disable the
    option append the characters 'no' to it. For example: 'noprint-parent'
    will disable the 'print-parent' option that prints the parent function in
    printing a function event.

*-o* 'outputfile'::
    By default, the extract command will create a 'trace.dat' file. This
    option will change where the file is written to.
