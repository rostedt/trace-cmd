TRACE-CMD-SPLIT(1)
==================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-split - split a trace.dat file into smaller files

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd split* ['OPTIONS'] ['start-time' ['end-time']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) split is used to break up a trace.dat into small files.
The 'start-time' specifies where the new file will start at. Using
'trace-cmd-report(1)' and copying the time stamp given at a particular event,
can be used as input for either 'start-time' or 'end-time'. The split will
stop creating files when it reaches an event after 'end-time'. If only the
end-time is needed, use 0.0 as the start-time.

If start-time is left out, then the split will start at the beginning of the
file. If end-time is left out, then split will continue to the end unless it
meets one of the requirements specified by the options.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i* 'file'::
    If this option is not specified, then the split command will look for the
    file named 'trace.dat'. This options will allow the reading of another
    file other than 'trace.dat'.

*-o* 'file'::
    By default, the split command will use the input file name as a basis of
    where to write the split files. The output file will be the input file
    with an attached \'.#\' to the end: trace.dat.1, trace.dat.2, etc.

    This option will change the name of the base file used.

    -o file  will create file.1, file.2, etc.

*-s* 'seconds'::
    This specifies how many seconds should be recorded before the new file
    should stop.

*-m* 'milliseconds'::
    This specifies how many milliseconds should be recorded before the new
    file should stop.

*-u* 'microseconds'::
    This specifies how many microseconds should be recorded before the new
    file should stop.

*-e* 'events'::
    This specifies how many events should be recorded before the new file
    should stop.

*-p* 'pages'::
    This specifies the number of pages that should be recorded before the new
    file should stop.

   Note: only one of *-p*, *-e*, *-u*, *-m*, *-s* may be specified at a time.

   If *-p* is specified, then *-c* is automatically set.

*-r*::
    This option causes the break up to repeat until end-time is reached (or
    end of the input if end-time is not specified).

    trace-cmd split -r -e 10000

    This will break up trace.dat into several smaller files, each with at most
    10,000 events in it.

*-c*::
    This option causes the above break up to be per CPU.

    trace-cmd split -c -p 10

    This will create a file that has 10 pages per each CPU from the input.
